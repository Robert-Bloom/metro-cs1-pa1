_first non-trivial programs in Java_

* * * 

_**School:** Metropolitan State University of Denver_

_**Course:** CS 1050 (aka CS 1)_

_**Term:** Fall 2017_

* * * 

### Goals

1. Write your first simple yet non-trivial standalone Java programs against explicit requirements.
2. Practice working in the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment (IDE).
3. Practice working with the version-control system `git` and the online development collaboration environment Github.
4. Practice programming against a test suite written in JUnit 5 library.
5. Practice class design.
6. Encounter a number of Java language features and best practices.
7. Start developing consistent coding style.

### Synopsis

This individual assignment consists of two separate and independent programs, _Calculator_ and _Pluralizer_. 

_Calculator_ asks you to develop a simple calculator class supporting the operations _addition_, _subtraction_, _multiplication_, _division_, and _modulo_.

_Pluralizer_ asks you to develop a simple class that, given English words, returns them in their plural form.

#### `Calculator`

Contrary to the prototypical assignment, this version will have to support:
  * both integers and decimals (doubles), by overloading
  * positive, negative, and zero values
  * modulo ONLY for integers
  * arbitrary white space between operands and operator, excluding new lines
  * parentheses for negative numbers
  * bonus: three operands w/ operator precedence


#### `Pluralizer`

In contrast from the prototypical version of the assignment:
  * the input will only be a word which might or might not be in singlular or plural form
  * irregular plurals are included
  * plurals identical with singular forms are included
